# CoffeeHacks-Bootstrap

I tried to create my own hackathon brand using Bootstrap! Using Replit, I also learnt about Version Control. Bootstrap is an Open-Source CSS framework so it's pretty cool to use [Bootstrap's code](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/) :)

Check out [here](https://learn-how-to-use-bootstrap.baileyluu.repl.co/)

## Inspiration
I have seen hackathon websites and they are so cool! My club will be hosting hackathon next year and I will take a role to create one. Thus, I wanna try out first :)

## What it does
Shows details about CoffeeHacks 

## How we built it
I used Bootstrap to make responsive website and Replit. I also used MLH hackathon season 22 banner to make it look real.

## Challenges we ran into
I have used Bootstrap before once, thus I have a bit knowledge of it. However, there are still so many things I haven't learnt ==> spent a lot of times learning and searching

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I'm able to create hackathon website for the first time!

## What we learned
Learnt so much about Bootstrap and how hard the organizers have to build the website. 

## What's next for Learn how to use Bootstrap
- Add more Sponsors part (since the hackathon is not real so I don't want to put legitimate sponsors)
